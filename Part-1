#Multiples of 3 and 5
Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Ans: 233168 

Solution: 
        def mul_3or5: 
           sum = 0
           for i in range(1000):
	            if i%3 ==0 or i%5 ==0:
	               sum += i
         return sum
         

#Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2 
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Ans: 4613732

Solution: 
        def even_fib_sum: 
           a, b, sum = 1, 2, 0
          while(a<=4000000):   # range is 4 million 
            if a%2 == 0:
              sum +=a
            a, b = b , a + b
          return sum
